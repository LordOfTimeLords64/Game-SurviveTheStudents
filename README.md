# Description:
This is the source code and files for a video game I made in my CSCI 276 course (Multimedia Programming &amp; Design). It was made using Processing, a flexible software sketchbook that uses Java.

You can chose to play as Professor Carl or Professor Engel. Each has a unique projectile that they can throw at the enemies. The enemies are the students, and you must move left and right to shoot the enemies using the space bar and arrow keys. The goal is to survive for as long as possible while the enemies increase in speed. If an enemy gets past you, you lose health.

My project partner and I were intending to implement mulitplayer; however, we did not have enough time and getting multiplayer to work in the way we wanted would've been a challenge. The files still have some leftover code from our attempts at implementing it is commented out or unused. If you have any feedback as to how we can implement multiplayer please let us know. Our main problem was trying to send whole objects using the default Processing Network library.

# How to install:

1. Download and install Processing from [processing.org](https://processing.org/)
2. Download the ```project2``` directory from this repo
3. Open a ```.pde``` file in the ```project2``` directory (the other ```.pde``` files should open automatically as tabs in the Processing app)
4. Click the run button at the top

# Note:

I tried to export the application as a single file, but it seems to not be working at the moment on my OS. I will try to do some testing and fix it later if possible.
